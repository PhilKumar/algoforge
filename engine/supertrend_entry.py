"""Supertrend on the hourly chart, expressed in NIFTY calls.

The rule, as measured and published in the Supertrend tearsheet
(docs/assets/supertrend-tearsheet.html, built from the eight-way-validated
CryptoForge sweep):

    On the 1-hour chart a supertrend (ATR 10, multiplier 1.5) sits below price
    while NIFTY trends up. The first hourly close back above it buys ONE NIFTY
    call at the money, on the NEXT week's expiry -- never this week's. The
    position is HELD OVERNIGHT. When price sits six strikes in the money the
    contract is ROLLED: sold, and a fresh at-the-money call bought the same
    minute. Once the index has run 100 points in the trade's favour a TRAIL
    arms; give back 80 points from the best level since entry and the trade is
    over. Otherwise it ends when the line flips bearish, or at expiry, 15:20.
    No stop loss. Puts lose under the mirror rule and are not traded.

WHY EACH OF THOSE IS THERE, since every one of them was measured against the
alternative and the alternatives are in the tearsheet:

  next-week expiry   a third of all entries land within a day of expiry on the
                     nearest weekly, and every one of those buckets lost.
  held overnight     squaring off daily loses at all 70 settings measured --
                     the overnight gaps are where a trend actually pays.
  the roll           it banks the gain at a real quoted price instead of
                     letting the strike drift out of reach, and it is what a
                     desk does for liquidity anyway.
  the trail, loose   every stop loss and every tight trail LOST money and RAISED
                     drawdown, because a stopped trade re-enters the same
                     still-bullish trend and pays another round trip.

This module is the rule and nothing else: no broker, no database, no clock of
its own. Candles, spot, premiums, expiries, lot sizes and charges all arrive as
callbacks, exactly as engine/gap_carry.py takes them, so the backtest route,
the paper loop and the tests all drive the same code.

The supertrend itself is NOT reimplemented here. It comes from
engine.indicators.supertrend -- the same function the Builder and the live
engine already use, and the same algorithm the published book was measured on.
Computing it twice is how a paper run quietly stops matching its own tearsheet.
